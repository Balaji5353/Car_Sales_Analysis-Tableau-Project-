## 📖 Storytelling  

### 🏆 Top Story  
“Car sales are on a growth trajectory with **$371M revenue (+24%)** and over **13K cars sold**. SUVs dominate revenue, and customers show strong preferences for Pale White and Black colors. Austin emerges as the leading region, while Chevrolet and Dodge drive volume. These insights suggest focusing on **SUVs, top-selling colors, and high-performing regions** to sustain growth.”  

### 🚨 Bottom Story  
“However, challenges exist. The **average price fell slightly**, pointing to margin pressure. Hardtop and Passenger models underperformed, and **Red cars contributed only $71M**, making them the weakest color choice. Regions like Middletown and brands like Audi lag significantly. These insights call for **reduced inventory in weak segments, targeted promotions, and strategic repositioning of underperforming models and colors**.”
